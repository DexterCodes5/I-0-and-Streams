43        	ROMEO AND JULIET

44        	PROLOGUE


45        	Two households, both alike in dignity,
46        	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
47        	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
48        	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
49        	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
50        	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
51        	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
52        	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
53        	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
54        	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
55        	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
56        	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
57        	The which if you with patient ears attend,
58        	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

60        ACT I



61        SCENE I	Verona. A public place.


62        	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
63        	armed with swords and bucklers]

64        SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

65        GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.

66        SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

67        GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

68        SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.

69        GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

70        SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

71        GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
72        	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

73        SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
74        	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

75        GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
76        	to the wall.

77        SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
78        	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
79        	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
80        	to the wall.

81        GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

82        SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
83        	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
84        	maids, and cut off their heads.

85        GREGORY	The heads of the maids?

86        SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
87        	take it in what sense thou wilt.

88        GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.

89        SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
90        	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

91        GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
92        	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
93        	two of the house of the Montagues.

94        SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

95        GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?

96        SAMPSON	Fear me not.

97        GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!

98        SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

99        GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
100       	they list.

101       SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
102       	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

103       	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]

104       ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

105       SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.

106       ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

107       SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
108       	ay?

109       GREGORY	No.

110       SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
111       	bite my thumb, sir.

112       GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?

113       ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.

114       SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

115       ABRAHAM	No better.

116       SAMPSON	Well, sir.

117       GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

118       SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.

119       ABRAHAM	You lie.

120       SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

121       	[They fight]

122       	[Enter BENVOLIO]

123       BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
124       	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

125       	[Beats down their swords]

126       	[Enter TYBALT]

127       TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
128       	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

129       BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
130       	Or manage it to part these men with me.

131       TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
132       	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
133       	Have at thee, coward!

134       	[They fight]

135       	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
136       	then enter Citizens, with clubs]

137       First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
138       	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

139       	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]

140       CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

141       LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

142       CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
143       	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

144       	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

145       MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

146       LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

147       	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]

148       PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
149       	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
150       	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
151       	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
152       	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
153       	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
154       	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
155       	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
156       	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
157       	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
158       	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
159       	And made Verona's ancient citizens
160       	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
161       	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
162       	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
163       	If ever you disturb our streets again,
164       	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
165       	For this time, all the rest depart away:
166       	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
167       	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
168       	To know our further pleasure in this case,
169       	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
170       	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

171       	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]

172       MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
173       	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

174       BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
175       	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
176       	I drew to part them: in the instant came
177       	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
178       	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
179       	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
180       	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
181       	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
182       	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
183       	Till the prince came, who parted either part.

184       LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
185       	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

186       BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
187       	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
188       	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
189       	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
190       	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
191       	So early walking did I see your son:
192       	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
193       	And stole into the covert of the wood:
194       	I, measuring his affections by my own,
195       	That most are busied when they're most alone,
196       	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
197       	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

198       MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
199       	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
200       	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
201       	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
202       	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
203       	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
204       	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
205       	And private in his chamber pens himself,
206       	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
207       	And makes himself an artificial night:
208       	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
209       	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

210       BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

211       MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.

212       BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?

213       MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
214       	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
215       	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
216       	But to himself so secret and so close,
217       	So far from sounding and discovery,
218       	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
219       	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
220       	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
221       	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
222       	We would as willingly give cure as know.

223       	[Enter ROMEO]

224       BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
225       	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

226       MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
227       	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

228       	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

229       BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.

230       ROMEO	Is the day so young?

231       BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.

232       ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
233       	Was that my father that went hence so fast?

234       BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

235       ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

236       BENVOLIO	In love?

237       ROMEO	Out--

238       BENVOLIO	Of love?

239       ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.

240       BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
241       	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

242       ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
243       	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
244       	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
245       	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
246       	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
247       	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
248       	O any thing, of nothing first create!
249       	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
250       	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
251       	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
252       	sick health!
253       	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
254       	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
255       	Dost thou not laugh?

256       BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.

257       ROMEO	Good heart, at what?

258       BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.

259       ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
260       	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
261       	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
262       	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
263       	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
264       	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
265       	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
266       	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
267       	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
268       	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
269       	Farewell, my coz.

270       BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;
271       	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

272       ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
273       	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

274       BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

275       ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?

276       BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
277       	But sadly tell me who.

278       ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
279       	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
280       	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

281       BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

282       ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

283       BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

284       ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
285       	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
286       	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
287       	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
288       	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
289       	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
290       	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
291       	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
292       	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

293       BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

294       ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
295       	For beauty starved with her severity
296       	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
297       	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
298       	To merit bliss by making me despair:
299       	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
300       	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

301       BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

302       ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.

303       BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
304       	Examine other beauties.

305       ROMEO	'Tis the way
306       	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
307       	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
308       	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
309       	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
310       	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
311       	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
312       	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
313       	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
314       	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

315       BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

321       CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,

327       CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
328       	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
329       	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
330       	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
331       	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

332       PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.

333       CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
334       	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
335       	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
336       	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
337       	My will to her consent is but a part;
338       	An she agree, within her scope of choice
339       	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
340       	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
341       	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
342       	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
343       	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
344       	At my poor house look to behold this night
345       	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
346       	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
347       	When well-apparell'd April on the heel
348       	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
349       	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
350       	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
351       	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
352       	Which on more view, of many mine being one
353       	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
354       	Come, go with me.

355       	[To Servant, giving a paper]

356       	Go, sirrah, trudge about
357       	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
358       	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
359       	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

360       	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]

361       Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is
362       	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
363       	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
364       	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
365       	sent to find those persons whose names are here
366       	writ, and can never find what names the writing
367       	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

368       	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]

369       BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
370       	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
371       	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
372       	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
373       	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
374       	And the rank poison of the old will die.

375       ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

376       BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?

377       ROMEO	For your broken shin.

378       BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

379       ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
380       	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
381       	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

382       Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

383       ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

384       Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
385       	pray, can you read any thing you see?

386       ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

387       Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

388       ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.

389       	[Reads]

395       	Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin

397       	assembly: whither should they come?

398       Servant	Up.

399       ROMEO	Whither?

400       Servant	To supper; to our house.

401       ROMEO	Whose house?

402       Servant	My master's.

403       ROMEO	Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

404       Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
405       	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
406       	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
407       	Rest you merry!

409       BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
410       	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
411       	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
412       	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
413       	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
414       	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

415       ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
416       	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
417       	And these, who often drown'd could never die,

419       	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
420       	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

421       BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
422       	Herself poised with herself in either eye:
423       	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
424       	Your lady's love against some other maid
425       	That I will show you shining at this feast,
426       	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

427       ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

432       SCENE III	A room in Capulet's house.


433       	[Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]

434       LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

435       Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
436       	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
437       	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

438       	[Enter JULIET]

439       JULIET	How now! who calls?

440       Nurse	Your mother.

441       JULIET	Madam, I am here.
442       	What is your will?

443       LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
444       	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
445       	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
446       	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

447       Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

448       LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.

449       Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
450       	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
451       	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
452       	To Lammas-tide?

453       LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.

454       Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
455       	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
456       	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
457       	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
458       	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
459       	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
460       	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
461       	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
462       	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
463       	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
464       	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
465       	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
466       	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
467       	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
468       	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
469       	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
470       	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
471       	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
472       	To bid me trudge:
473       	And since that time it is eleven years;
474       	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
475       	She could have run and waddled all about;
476       	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
477       	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
478       	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
479       	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
480       	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
481       	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
482       	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
483       	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
484       	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
485       	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
486       	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

487       LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

488       Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
489       	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
490       	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
491       	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
492       	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
493       	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
494       	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
495       	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

496       JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

497       Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
498       	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
499       	An I might live to see thee married once,
500       	I have my wish.

501       LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
502       	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
503       	How stands your disposition to be married?

504       JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.

505       Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
506       	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

507       LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
508       	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
509       	Are made already mothers: by my count,
510       	I was your mother much upon these years
511       	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
512       	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

513       Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
514       	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

515       LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

516       Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

517       LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
518       	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
519       	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
520       	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
521       	Examine every married lineament,
522       	And see how one another lends content
523       	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
524       	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
525       	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
526       	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
527       	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
528       	For fair without the fair within to hide:
529       	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
530       	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
531       	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
532       	By having him, making yourself no less.

533       Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

534       LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

535       JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
536       	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
537       	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

538       	[Enter a Servant]

539       Servant	Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you

542       	hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

551       	[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
552       	Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]

553       ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
554       	Or shall we on without a apology?

555       BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
556       	We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
557       	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
558       	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
559       	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
560       	After the prompter, for our entrance:
561       	But let them measure us by what they will;
562       	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

563       ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
564       	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

565       MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

566       ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
567       	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
568       	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

569       MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
570       	And soar with them above a common bound.

571       ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
572       	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
573       	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
574       	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

575       MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
576       	Too great oppression for a tender thing.

577       ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
578       	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

579       MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
580       	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
581       	Give me a case to put my visage in:
582       	A visor for a visor! what care I
583       	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
584       	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

585       BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
586       	But every man betake him to his legs.

587       ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
588       	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
589       	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
590       	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
591       	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

592       MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
593       	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
594       	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
595       	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

596       ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.

597       MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
598       	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
599       	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
600       	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

601       ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;
602       	But 'tis no wit to go.

603       MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?

604       ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.

605       MERCUTIO	And so did I.

606       ROMEO	Well, what was yours?

607       MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.

608       ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

609       MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
610       	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
611       	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
612       	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
613       	Drawn with a team of little atomies
614       	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
615       	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
616       	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
617       	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
618       	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
619       	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
620       	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
621       	Not so big as a round little worm
622       	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
623       	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
624       	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
625       	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
626       	And in this state she gallops night by night
627       	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
628       	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
629       	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
630       	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
631       	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
632       	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
633       	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
634       	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
635       	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
636       	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
637       	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
638       	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
639       	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
640       	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
641       	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
642       	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
643       	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
644       	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
645       	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
646       	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
647       	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
648       	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
649       	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
650       	Making them women of good carriage:
651       	This is she--

652       ROMEO	                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
653       	Thou talk'st of nothing.

654       MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
655       	Which are the children of an idle brain,
656       	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
657       	Which is as thin of substance as the air
658       	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
659       	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
660       	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
661       	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

662       BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
663       	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

664       ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
665       	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
666       	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
667       	With this night's revels and expire the term
668       	Of a despised life closed in my breast
669       	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
670       	But He, that hath the steerage of my course,

679       	shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

680       Second Servant	When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
681       	hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

682       First Servant	Away with the joint-stools, remove the
683       	court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
684       	me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
685       	the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
686       	Antony, and Potpan!

687       Second Servant	Ay, boy, ready.

688       First Servant	You are looked for and called for, asked for and
689       	sought for, in the great chamber.

690       Second Servant	We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
691       	brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

692       	[Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house,
693       	meeting the Guests and Maskers]

694       CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
695       	Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
696       	Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
697       	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
698       	She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
699       	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
700       	That I have worn a visor and could tell
701       	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
702       	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
703       	You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
704       	A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

705       	[Music plays, and they dance]

706       	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
707       	And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
708       	Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
709       	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
710       	For you and I are past our dancing days:
711       	How long is't now since last yourself and I
712       	Were in a mask?

713       Second Capulet	                  By'r lady, thirty years.

714       CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
715       	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
716       	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
717       	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

718       Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
719       	His son is thirty.

720       CAPULET	                  Will you tell me that?
721       	His son was but a ward two years ago.

722       ROMEO	[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth
723       	enrich the hand
724       	Of yonder knight?

725       Servant	I know not, sir.

726       ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
727       	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
728       	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
729       	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
730       	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
731       	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
732       	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
733       	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
734       	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
735       	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

736       TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
737       	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
738       	Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
739       	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
740       	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
741       	To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

742       CAPULET	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

743       TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
744       	A villain that is hither come in spite,
745       	To scorn at our solemnity this night.

746       CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?

747       TYBALT	'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

748       CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
749       	He bears him like a portly gentleman;
750       	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
751       	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
752       	I would not for the wealth of all the town
753       	Here in my house do him disparagement:
754       	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
755       	It is my will, the which if thou respect,
756       	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
757       	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

758       TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
759       	I'll not endure him.

760       CAPULET	He shall be endured:
761       	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
762       	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
763       	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
764       	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
765       	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

766       TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

767       CAPULET	Go to, go to;
768       	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
769       	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
770       	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
771       	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
772       	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
773       	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

774       TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
775       	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
776       	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
777       	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

778       	[Exit]

779       ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
780       	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
781       	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
782       	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

783       JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
784       	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
785       	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
786       	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

787       ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

788       JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

789       ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
790       	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

791       JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

792       ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
793       	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

794       JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

795       ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
796       	Give me my sin again.

797       JULIET	You kiss by the book.

798       Nurse	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

799       ROMEO	What is her mother?

800       Nurse	Marry, bachelor,
801       	Her mother is the lady of the house,
802       	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
803       	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
804       	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
805       	Shall have the chinks.

806       ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
807       	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

808       BENVOLIO	Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

809       ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

810       CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
811       	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
812       	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
813       	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
814       	More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
815       	Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:

818       JULIET	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

819       Nurse	The son and heir of old Tiberio.

821       Nurse	Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

822       JULIET	What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

823       Nurse	I know not.

824       JULIET	Go ask his name: if he be married.
825       	My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

826       Nurse	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
827       	The only son of your great enemy.

828       JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
829       	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
830       	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
831       	That I must love a loathed enemy.

832       Nurse	What's this? what's this?

833       JULIET	A rhyme I learn'd even now
834       	Of one I danced withal.

835       	[One calls within 'Juliet.']

842       	[Enter Chorus]

843       Chorus	Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
844       	And young affection gapes to be his heir;
845       	That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
846       	With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
847       	Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
848       	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
849       	But to his foe supposed he must complain,
850       	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
851       	Being held a foe, he may not have access
852       	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
853       	And she as much in love, her means much less
854       	To meet her new-beloved any where:
855       	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
856       	Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

872       	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
873       	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:

880       	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
881       	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
882       	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
883       	By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
884       	By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
885       	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
886       	That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

887       BENVOLIO	And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

888       MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
889       	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
890       	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
891       	Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
892       	That were some spite: my invocation

932       	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
933       	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
934       	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
935       	Would through the airy region stream so bright
936       	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
937       	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!

965       	Take all myself.

966       ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:
967       	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
968       	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

969       JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
970       	So stumblest on my counsel?

971       ROMEO	By a name
972       	I know not how to tell thee who I am:
973       	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
974       	Because it is an enemy to thee;
975       	Had I it written, I would tear the word.

976       JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
977       	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
978       	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

979       ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

980       JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
981       	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
982       	And the place death, considering who thou art,
983       	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

984       ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
985       	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
986       	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
987       	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

988       JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

989       ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
990       	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
991       	And I am proof against their enmity.

992       JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.

993       ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
994       	And but thou love me, let them find me here:
995       	My life were better ended by their hate,
996       	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

997       JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

998       ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
999       	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1000      	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1001      	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1002      	I would adventure for such merchandise.

1003      JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1004      	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1005      	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1006      	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1007      	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1008      	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1009      	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1010      	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1011      	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1012      	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1013      	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1014      	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1015      	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1016      	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1017      	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1018      	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1019      	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1020      	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1021      	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1022      	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1023      	And not impute this yielding to light love,
1024      	Which the dark night hath so discovered.

1025      ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1026      	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

1027      JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1028      	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1029      	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

1030      ROMEO	What shall I swear by?

1031      JULIET	Do not swear at all;
1032      	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1033      	Which is the god of my idolatry,
1034      	And I'll believe thee.

1035      ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--

1036      JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1037      	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1038      	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1039      	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1040      	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1041      	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1042      	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1043      	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1044      	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

1045      ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

1046      JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

1047      ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

1048      JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1049      	And yet I would it were to give again.

1050      ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

1051      JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1052      	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1053      	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1054      	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1055      	The more I have, for both are infinite.

1056      	[Nurse calls within]

1057      	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1058      	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1059      	Stay but a little, I will come again.

1060      	[Exit, above]

1061      ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1062      	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1063      	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

1064      	[Re-enter JULIET, above]

1065      JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1066      	If that thy bent of love be honourable,

1068      	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1069      	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1070      	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1071      	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

1072      Nurse	[Within]  Madam!

1073      JULIET	I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1074      	I do beseech thee--

1075      Nurse	[Within]  Madam!

1076      JULIET	By and by, I come:--
1077      	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1078      	To-morrow will I send.

1079      ROMEO	So thrive my soul--

1080      JULIET	A thousand times good night!

1081      	[Exit, above]

1082      ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1083      	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1084      	their books,
1085      	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

1086      	[Retiring]

1088      JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1089      	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1090      	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1091      	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1092      	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1093      	With repetition of my Romeo's name.

1094      ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1095      	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1096      	Like softest music to attending ears!

1097      JULIET	Romeo!

1098      ROMEO	     My dear?

1099      JULIET	                  At what o'clock to-morrow
1100      	Shall I send to thee?

1101      ROMEO	At the hour of nine.

1102      JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1103      	I have forgot why I did call thee back.

1104      ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.

1105      JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1106      	Remembering how I love thy company.

1107      ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1108      	Forgetting any other home but this.

1109      JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1110      	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1111      	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1112      	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1113      	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1114      	So loving-jealous of his liberty.

1115      ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.

1116      JULIET	Sweet, so would I:

1129      SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.


1130      	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]

1131      FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1132      	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1133      	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1134      	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1135      	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1136      	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1137      	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1138      	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1139      	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1140      	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1141      	And from her womb children of divers kind
1142      	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1143      	Many for many virtues excellent,
1144      	None but for some and yet all different.
1145      	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1146      	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1147      	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1148      	But to the earth some special good doth give,
1149      	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1150      	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1151      	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1152      	And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1153      	Within the infant rind of this small flower
1154      	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1155      	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1156      	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1157      	Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1158      	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1159      	And where the worser is predominant,
1160      	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

1161      	[Enter ROMEO]

1162      ROMEO	Good morrow, father.

1163      FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
1164      	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1165      	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1166      	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1167      	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1168      	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1169      	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1170      	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1171      	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1172      	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1173      	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1174      	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

1175      ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

1176      FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

1177      ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1178      	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

1179      FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

1180      ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1181      	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1182      	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1183      	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1184      	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1185      	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1186      	My intercession likewise steads my foe.

1187      FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1188      	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

1189      ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1190      	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1191      	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1192      	And all combined, save what thou must combine
1193      	By holy marriage: when and where and how
1194      	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1195      	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1196      	That thou consent to marry us to-day.

1197      FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1198      	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1199      	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1200      	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1201      	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1202      	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1203      	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1204      	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1205      	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1206      	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1207      	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1208      	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1209      	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1210      	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1211      	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1212      	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

1213      ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

1214      FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

1215      ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.

1216      FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
1217      	To lay one in, another out to have.

1218      ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1219      	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1220      	The other did not so.

1221      FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well
1222      	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1223      	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1224      	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1225      	For this alliance may so happy prove,
1226      	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

1227      ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

1228      FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

1234      MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1235      	Came he not home to-night?

1236      BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

1237      MERCUTIO	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1238      	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

1239      BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1240      	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

1241      MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.

1242      BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.

1244      BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1245      	dares, being dared.

1246      MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1247      	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1248      	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1249      	blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1250      	encounter Tybalt?

1251      BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?

1252      MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1253      	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1254      	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1255      	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1256      	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1257      	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1258      	very first house, of the first and second cause:
1259      	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1260      	hai!

1264      	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good

1286      	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

1287      MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1288      	constrains a man to bow in the hams.

1289      ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.

1290      MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.

1291      ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.

1292      MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

1293      ROMEO	Pink for flower.

1294      MERCUTIO	Right.

1295      ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.

1296      MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1297      	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1298      	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

1299      ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1300      	singleness.

1301      MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

1302      ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

1303      MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1304      	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1305      	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1306      	was I with you there for the goose?

1307      ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1308      	not there for the goose.

1309      MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

1310      ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.

1311      MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1312      	sharp sauce.

1313      ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

1314      MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1315      	inch narrow to an ell broad!

1316      ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1317      	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

1318      MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1319      	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1320      	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1321      	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1322      	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

1323      BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.

1324      MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

1325      BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

1326      MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1327      	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1328      	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

1329      ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!

1330      	[Enter Nurse and PETER]

1331      MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!

1332      BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

1333      Nurse	Peter!

1334      PETER	Anon!

1335      Nurse	My fan, Peter.

1336      MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1337      	fairer face.

1338      Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

1339      MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

1340      Nurse	Is it good den?

1341      MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1342      	dial is now upon the prick of noon.

1343      Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!

1344      ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1345      	mar.

1346      Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1347      	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1348      	may find the young Romeo?

1349      ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1350      	you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1351      	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

1352      Nurse	You say well.

1353      MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1354      	wisely, wisely.

1355      Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1356      	you.

1357      BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.

1358      MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

1359      ROMEO	What hast thou found?

1360      MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1361      	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.

1362      	[Sings]

1363      	An old hare hoar,
1364      	And an old hare hoar,
1365      	Is very good meat in lent
1366      	But a hare that is hoar
1367      	Is too much for a score,
1368      	When it hoars ere it be spent.
1369      	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1370      	to dinner, thither.

1371      ROMEO	I will follow you.

1372      MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

1373      	[Singing]

1374      	'lady, lady, lady.'

1375      	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]

1376      Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1377      	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

1378      ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1379      	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1380      	to in a month.

1381      Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1382      	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1383      	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1384      	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1385      	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1386      	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

1387      PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1388      	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1389      	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1390      	good quarrel, and the law on my side.

1391      Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1392      	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1393      	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1394      	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1395      	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1396      	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1397      	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1398      	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1399      	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1400      	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

1401      ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1402      	protest unto thee--

1403      Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1404      	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

1405      ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

1406      Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1407      	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

1408      ROMEO	Bid her devise
1409      	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1410      	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1411      	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

1412      Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.

1413      ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.

1414      Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

1415      ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1416      	Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1417      	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1418      	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1419      	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1420      	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1421      	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

1422      Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

1423      ROMEO	What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

1424      Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1425      	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

1426      ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

1427      NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1428      	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1429      	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1430      	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1431      	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1432      	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1433      	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1434      	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1435      	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

1436      ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

1437      Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1438      	the--No; I know it begins with some other
1439      	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1440      	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1441      	to hear it.

1442      ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.

1443      Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.

1444      	[Exit Romeo]

1452      	[Enter JULIET]

1453      JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1454      	In half an hour she promised to return.
1455      	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1456      	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1457      	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1458      	Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1459      	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1460      	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1461      	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1462      	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1463      	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1464      	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1465      	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1466      	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1467      	And his to me:
1468      	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1469      	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1470      	O God, she comes!

1471      	[Enter Nurse and PETER]

1472      	O honey nurse, what news?
1473      	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

1474      Nurse	Peter, stay at the gate.

1475      	[Exit PETER]

1476      JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1477      	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1478      	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1479      	By playing it to me with so sour a face.

1480      Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1481      	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

1482      JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1483      	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

1484      Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1485      	Do you not see that I am out of breath?

1486      JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1487      	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1488      	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1489      	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1490      	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1491      	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1492      	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

1493      Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1494      	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1495      	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1496      	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1497      	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1498      	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1499      	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1500      	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

1501      JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
1502      	What says he of our marriage? what of that?

1503      Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1504      	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1505      	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1506      	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1507      	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

1508      JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1509      	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

1510      Nurse	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1511      	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1512      	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

1513      JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1514      	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1515      	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1516      	Where is your mother?'

1517      Nurse	O God's lady dear!
1518      	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1519      	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1520      	Henceforward do your messages yourself.

1521      JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

1522      Nurse	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

1523      JULIET	I have.

1524      Nurse	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1525      	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1526      	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1527      	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1528      	Hie you to church; I must another way,
1529      	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1530      	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1531      	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1532      	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1533      	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

1540      FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1541      	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

1542      ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1543      	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1544      	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1545      	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1546      	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1547      	It is enough I may but call her mine.

1548      FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends
1549      	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1550      	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1551      	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1552      	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1553      	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1554      	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

1555      	[Enter JULIET]

1556      	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1557      	Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1558      	A lover may bestride the gossamer
1559      	That idles in the wanton summer air,
1560      	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

1561      JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.

1562      FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

1563      JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

1565      	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1566      	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1567      	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1568      	Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1569      	Receive in either by this dear encounter.

1570      JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1571      	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
1572      	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1573      	But my true love is grown to such excess

1586      	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

1587      MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he

1589      	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of

1600      	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
1601      	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1602      	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
1603      	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
1604      	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
1605      	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
1606      	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
1607      	man for coughing in the street, because he hath
1608      	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
1609      	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
1610      	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
1611      	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
1612      	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

1613      BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
1614      	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

1615      MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!

1616      BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.

1617      MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.

1618      	[Enter TYBALT and others]

1619      TYBALT	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
1620      	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

1621      MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with
1622      	something; make it a word and a blow.

1623      TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
1624      	will give me occasion.

1625      MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?

1626      TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

1627      MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
1628      	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
1629      	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
1630      	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

1631      BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
1632      	Either withdraw unto some private place,
1633      	And reason coldly of your grievances,
1634      	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

1635      MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
1636      	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

1637      	[Enter ROMEO]

1638      TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

1639      MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
1640      	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
1641      	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

1642      TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
1643      	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

1644      ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
1645      	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
1646      	To such a greeting: villain am I none;
1647      	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

1648      TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
1649      	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

1650      ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,
1651      	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
1652      	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
1653      	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
1654      	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

1655      MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
1656      	Alla stoccata carries it away.

1657      	[Draws]

1658      	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

1659      TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?

1660      MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
1661      	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
1662      	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
1663      	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
1664      	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
1665      	ears ere it be out.

1666      TYBALT	I am for you.

1667      	[Drawing]

1668      ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

1669      MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.

1670      	[They fight]

1671      ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
1672      	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
1673      	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
1674      	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
1675      	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

1676      	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies
1677      	with his followers]

1678      MERCUTIO	I am hurt.
1679      	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
1680      	Is he gone, and hath nothing?

1681      BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?

1682      MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
1683      	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

1684      	[Exit Page]

1685      ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

1686      MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
1687      	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
1688      	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
1689      	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
1690      	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
1691      	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
1692      	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
1693      	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
1694      	was hurt under your arm.

1695      ROMEO	I thought all for the best.

1696      MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,
1697      	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
1698      	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
1699      	And soundly too: your houses!

1700      	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]

1701      ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
1702      	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
1703      	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
1704      	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
1705      	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
1706      	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
1707      	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

1708      	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]

1709      BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
1710      	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
1711      	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

1712      ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
1713      	This but begins the woe, others must end.

1714      BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

1715      ROMEO	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
1716      	Away to heaven, respective lenity,
1717      	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

1718      	[Re-enter TYBALT]

1719      	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
1720      	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
1721      	Is but a little way above our heads,
1722      	Staying for thine to keep him company:
1723      	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

1724      TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
1725      	Shalt with him hence.

1726      ROMEO	This shall determine that.

1727      	[They fight; TYBALT falls]

1728      BENVOLIO	Romeo, away, be gone!
1729      	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
1730      	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
1731      	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

1732      ROMEO	O, I am fortune's fool!

1733      BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?

1734      	[Exit ROMEO]

1735      	[Enter Citizens, &c]

1736      First Citizen	Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
1737      	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

1738      BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.

1739      First Citizen	Up, sir, go with me;
1740      	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

1741      	[Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their
1742      	Wives, and others]

1743      PRINCE	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

1744      BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all
1745      	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
1746      	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
1747      	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

1748      LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
1749      	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
1750      	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
1751      	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
1752      	O cousin, cousin!

1753      PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

1754      BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
1755      	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
1756      	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
1757      	Your high displeasure: all this uttered
1758      	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
1759      	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
1760      	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
1761      	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
1762      	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
1763      	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
1764      	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
1765      	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
1766      	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
1767      	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
1768      	his tongue,
1769      	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
1770      	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
1771      	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
1772      	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
1773      	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
1774      	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
1775      	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
1776      	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
1777      	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
1778      	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

1779      LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
1780      	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
1781      	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
1782      	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
1783      	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
1784      	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

1785      PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
1786      	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

1787      MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
1788      	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
1789      	The life of Tybalt.

1790      PRINCE	And for that offence
1791      	Immediately we do exile him hence:
1792      	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
1793      	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
1794      	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
1795      	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
1796      	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
1797      	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
1798      	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
1799      	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
1800      	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
1801      	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

1804      ACT III



1805      SCENE II	Capulet's orchard.


1806      	[Enter JULIET]

1807      JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
1808      	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
1809      	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
1810      	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
1811      	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
1812      	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
1813      	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
1814      	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
1815      	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
1816      	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
1817      	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
1818      	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
1819      	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
1820      	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
1821      	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
1822      	Think true love acted simple modesty.
1823      	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
1824      	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
1825      	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
1826      	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
1827      	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
1828      	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
1829      	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
1830      	That all the world will be in love with night
1831      	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
1832      	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
1833      	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
1834      	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
1835      	As is the night before some festival
1836      	To an impatient child that hath new robes
1837      	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
1838      	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
1839      	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

1840      	[Enter Nurse, with cords]

1841      	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
1842      	That Romeo bid thee fetch?

1843      Nurse	Ay, ay, the cords.

1844      	[Throws them down]

1845      JULIET	Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

1846      Nurse	Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
1847      	We are undone, lady, we are undone!
1848      	Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

1849      JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?

1850      Nurse	Romeo can,
1851      	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
1852      	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

1853      JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
1854      	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
1855      	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
1856      	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
1857      	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
1858      	I am not I, if there be such an I;
1859      	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
1860      	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
1861      	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

1862      Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
1863      	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
1864      	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
1865      	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
1866      	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

1867      JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
1868      	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
1869      	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
1870      	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

1871      Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
1872      	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
1873      	That ever I should live to see thee dead!

1874      JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
1875      	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
1876      	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
1877      	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
1878      	For who is living, if those two are gone?

1879      Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
1880      	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

1881      JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

1882      Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

1883      JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
1884      	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
1885      	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
1886      	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
1887      	Despised substance of divinest show!
1888      	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
1889      	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
1890      	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
1891      	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
1892      	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
1893      	Was ever book containing such vile matter
1894      	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
1895      	In such a gorgeous palace!

1896      Nurse	There's no trust,
1897      	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
1898      	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
1899      	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
1900      	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
1901      	Shame come to Romeo!

1902      JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue
1903      	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
1904      	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
1905      	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
1906      	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
1907      	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

1908      Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

1909      JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
1910      	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
1911      	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
1912      	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
1913      	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
1914      	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
1915      	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
1916      	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
1917      	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
1918      	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
1919      	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
1920      	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
1921      	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
1922      	But, O, it presses to my memory,
1923      	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
1924      	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
1925      	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
1926      	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
1927      	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
1928      	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
1929      	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
1930      	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
1931      	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
1932      	Which modern lamentations might have moved?
1933      	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
1934      	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
1935      	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
1936      	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
1937      	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
1938      	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
1939      	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

1940      Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
1941      	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

1942      JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
1943      	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
1944      	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
1945      	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
1946      	He made you for a highway to my bed;
1947      	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
1948      	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
1949      	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

1950      Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
1951      	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
1952      	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
1953      	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

1954      JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
1955      	And bid him come to take his last farewell.

1959      SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.


1960      	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]

1961      FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
1962      	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
1963      	And thou art wedded to calamity.

1964      	[Enter ROMEO]

1965      ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
1966      	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
1967      	That I yet know not?

1968      FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
1969      	Is my dear son with such sour company:
1970      	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

1971      ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

1972      FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
1973      	Not body's death, but body's banishment.

1974      ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
1975      	For exile hath more terror in his look,
1976      	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

1977      FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:
1978      	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

1979      ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
1980      	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
1981      	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
1982      	And world's exile is death: then banished,
1983      	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
1984      	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
1985      	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

1986      FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
1987      	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
1988      	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
1989      	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
1990      	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

1991      ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
1992      	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
1993      	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
1994      	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
1995      	But Romeo may not: more validity,
1996      	More honourable state, more courtship lives
1997      	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
1998      	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
1999      	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2000      	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2001      	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2002      	But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2003      	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2004      	They are free men, but I am banished.
2005      	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2006      	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2007      	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2008      	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2009      	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2010      	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2011      	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2012      	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2013      	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

2014      FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

2015      ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

2016      FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2017      	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2018      	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

2019      ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2020      	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2021      	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2022      	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

2023      FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

2024      ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

2025      FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

2026      ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2027      	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2028      	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2029      	Doting like me and like me banished,
2030      	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2031      	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2032      	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

2033      	[Knocking within]

2034      FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

2035      ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2036      	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

2037      	[Knocking]

2038      FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2039      	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;

2040      	[Knocking]

2041      	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2042      	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!

2043      	[Knocking]

2044      	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

2045      Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know
2046      	my errand;
2047      	I come from Lady Juliet.

2048      FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.

2049      	[Enter Nurse]

2050      Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2051      	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

2052      FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

2053      Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2054      	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2055      	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2056      	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2057      	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2058      	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2059      	Why should you fall into so deep an O?

2060      ROMEO	Nurse!

2061      Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

2062      ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2063      	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2064      	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2065      	With blood removed but little from her own?
2066      	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2067      	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

2068      Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2069      	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2070      	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2071      	And then down falls again.

2072      ROMEO	As if that name,
2073      	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2074      	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2075      	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2076      	In what vile part of this anatomy
2077      	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2078      	The hateful mansion.

2079      	[Drawing his sword]

2080      FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
2081      	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2082      	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2083      	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2084      	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2085      	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2086      	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2087      	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2088      	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2089      	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2090      	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2091      	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2092      	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2093      	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2094      	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2095      	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2096      	And usest none in that true use indeed
2097      	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2098      	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2099      	Digressing from the valour of a man;
2100      	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2101      	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2102      	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2103      	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2104      	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2105      	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2106      	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2107      	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2108      	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2109      	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2110      	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2111      	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2112      	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2113      	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2114      	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2115      	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2116      	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2117      	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2118      	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2119      	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2120      	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2121      	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2122      	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2123      	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2124      	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2125      	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2126      	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2127      	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2128      	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2129      	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2130      	Romeo is coming.

2131      Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2132      	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2133      	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

2134      ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

2135      Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2136      	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

2137      	[Exit]

2138      ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!

2139      FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2140      	Either be gone before the watch be set,
2141      	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2142      	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2143      	And he shall signify from time to time
2144      	Every good hap to you that chances here:
2145      	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

2146      ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2147      	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

2153      CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,

2156      	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2157      	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2158      	I promise you, but for your company,
2159      	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

2160      PARIS	These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2161      	Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

2162      LADY CAPULET	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2163      	To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

2164      CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2165      	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled

2167      	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2168      	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2169      	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2170      	But, soft! what day is this?

2171      PARIS	Monday, my lord,

2174      	She shall be married to this noble earl.
2175      	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2176      	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2177      	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2178      	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2179      	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2180      	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2181      	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

2182      PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

2195      JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2196      	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2197      	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2198      	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2199      	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

2200      ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2201      	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2202      	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2203      	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2204      	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2205      	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

2206      JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2207      	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,

2209      	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2210      	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

2213      	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,

2216      	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2217      	I have more care to stay than will to go:
2218      	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2219      	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

2220      JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2221      	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2222      	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2223      	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2224      	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2225      	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,

2237      JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

2238      ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

2239      	[He goeth down]

2240      JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2241      	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2242      	For in a minute there are many days:
2243      	O, by this count I shall be much in years
2244      	Ere I again behold my Romeo!

2245      ROMEO	Farewell!
2246      	I will omit no opportunity
2247      	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

2248      JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

2249      ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2250      	For sweet discourses in our time to come.

2251      JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2252      	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2253      	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2254      	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

2255      ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2256      	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

2257      	[Exit]

2258      JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2259      	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2260      	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2261      	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2262      	But send him back.

2263      LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?

2264      JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2265      	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2266      	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

2267      	[Enter LADY CAPULET]

2268      LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!

2269      JULIET	Madam, I am not well.

2270      LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2271      	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2272      	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2273      	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2274      	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

2275      JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

2276      LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2277      	Which you weep for.

2278      JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
2279      	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

2280      LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2281      	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

2282      JULIET	What villain madam?

2283      LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.

2284      JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2285      	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2286      	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

2287      LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

2288      JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2289      	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

2290      LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2291      	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2292      	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2293      	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2294      	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2295      	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

2296      JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2297      	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2298      	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2299      	Madam, if you could find out but a man
2300      	To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2301      	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2302      	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2303      	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2304      	To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2305      	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

2306      LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2307      	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

2308      JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2309      	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

2310      LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2311      	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2312      	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2313      	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

2314      JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

2315      LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2316      	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2317      	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2318      	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

2319      JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2320      	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2321      	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2322      	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2323      	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2324      	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2325      	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2326      	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

2327      LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2328      	And see how he will take it at your hands.

2329      	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]

2330      CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2331      	But for the sunset of my brother's son
2332      	It rains downright.
2333      	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2334      	Evermore showering? In one little body
2335      	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2336      	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2337      	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2338      	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2339      	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2340      	Without a sudden calm, will overset
2341      	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2342      	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

2343      LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2344      	I would the fool were married to her grave!

2345      CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2346      	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2347      	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2348      	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2349      	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

2350      JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2351      	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2352      	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

2353      CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2354      	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2355      	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2356      	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2357      	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
2358      	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2359      	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2360      	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2361      	You tallow-face!

2362      LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

2363      JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2364      	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

2365      CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2366      	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2367      	Or never after look me in the face:
2368      	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
2369      	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2370      	That God had lent us but this only child;
2371      	But now I see this one is one too much,
2372      	And that we have a curse in having her:
2373      	Out on her, hilding!

2374      Nurse	God in heaven bless her!
2375      	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

2376      CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
2377      	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

2378      Nurse	I speak no treason.

2379      CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.

2380      Nurse	May not one speak?

2381      CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!
2382      	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
2383      	For here we need it not.

2384      LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.

2385      CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:
2386      	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
2387      	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
2388      	To have her match'd: and having now provided
2389      	A gentleman of noble parentage,
2390      	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2391      	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2392      	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
2393      	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2394      	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2395      	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
2396      	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
2397      	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
2398      	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
2399      	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
2400      	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2401      	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2402      	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
2403      	the streets,
2404      	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2405      	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
2406      	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

2407      	[Exit]

2408      JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
2409      	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2410      	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2411      	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2412      	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
2413      	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

2414      LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
2415      	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

2416      	[Exit]

2417      JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2418      	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
2419      	How shall that faith return again to earth,
2420      	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2421      	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
2422      	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2423      	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2424      	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
2425      	Some comfort, nurse.

2426      Nurse	Faith, here it is.
2427      	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
2428      	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2429      	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2430      	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2431      	I think it best you married with the county.
2432      	O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2433      	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
2434      	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2435      	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2436      	I think you are happy in this second match,
2437      	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
2438      	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
2439      	As living here and you no use of him.

2440      JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?

2441      Nurse	And from my soul too;
2442      	Or else beshrew them both.

2443      JULIET	Amen!

2444      Nurse	What?

2445      JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
2446      	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
2447      	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
2448      	To make confession and to be absolved.

2449      Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

2450      	[Exit]

2451      JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
2452      	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
2453      	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
2454      	Which she hath praised him with above compare
2455      	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
2456      	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
2457      	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
2458      	If all else fail, myself have power to die.

2461      ACT IV



2462      SCENE I	Friar Laurence's cell.


2463      	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]

2464      FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

2465      PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;
2466      	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

2467      FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
2468      	Uneven is the course, I like it not.

2469      PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
2470      	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
2471      	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
2472      	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
2473      	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
2474      	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
2475      	To stop the inundation of her tears;
2476      	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
2477      	May be put from her by society:
2478      	Now do you know the reason of this haste.

2479      FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
2480      	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.

2481      	[Enter JULIET]

2482      PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!

2483      JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

2484      PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

2485      JULIET	What must be shall be.

2486      FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.

2487      PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?

2488      JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.

2489      PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.

2490      JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.

2491      PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

2492      JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
2493      	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

2494      PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

2495      JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
2496      	For it was bad enough before their spite.

2497      PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

2498      JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
2499      	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

2500      PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

2501      JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
2502      	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
2503      	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

2504      FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
2505      	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

2506      PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!
2507      	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
2508      	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

2509      	[Exit]

2510      JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
2511      	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

2512      FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
2513      	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
2514      	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
2515      	On Thursday next be married to this county.

2516      JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
2517      	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
2518      	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
2519      	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
2520      	And with this knife I'll help it presently.
2521      	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
2522      	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
2523      	Shall be the label to another deed,
2524      	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
2525      	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
2526      	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
2527      	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
2528      	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
2529      	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
2530      	Which the commission of thy years and art
2531      	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
2532      	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
2533      	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

2534      FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
2535      	Which craves as desperate an execution.
2536      	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
2537      	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
2538      	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
2539      	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
2540      	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
2541      	That copest with death himself to scape from it:
2542      	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

2543      JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
2544      	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
2545      	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
2546      	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
2547      	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
2548      	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
2549      	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
2550      	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
2551      	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
2552      	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
2553      	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
2554      	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

2555      FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
2556      	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
2557      	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
2558      	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
2559      	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
2560      	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
2561      	When presently through all thy veins shall run
2562      	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
2563      	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
2564      	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
2565      	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
2566      	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
2567      	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
2568      	Each part, deprived of supple government,
2569      	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
2570      	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
2571      	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
2572      	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
2573      	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
2574      	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
2575      	Then, as the manner of our country is,
2576      	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
2577      	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
2578      	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
2579      	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
2580      	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
2581      	And hither shall he come: and he and I
2582      	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
2583      	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
2584      	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
2585      	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
2586      	Abate thy valour in the acting it.

2587      JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

2588      FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
2589      	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
2590      	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

2591      JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
2592      	Farewell, dear father!

2604      CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?

2605      Second Servant	Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his

2613      CAPULET	Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
2614      	A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

2616      	[Enter JULIET]

2622      	And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
2623      	Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

2624      CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:
2625      	I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

2626      JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
2627      	And gave him what becomed love I might,
2628      	Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

2629      CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
2630      	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
2631      	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
2632      	Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
2633      	Our whole city is much bound to him.

2634      JULIET	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
2635      	To help me sort such needful ornaments

2657      	I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
2658      	For I have need of many orisons
2659      	To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
2660      	Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

2665      	So please you, let me now be left alone,

2672      JULIET	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
2673      	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
2674      	That almost freezes up the heat of life:
2675      	I'll call them back again to comfort me:
2676      	Nurse! What should she do here?
2677      	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
2678      	Come, vial.
2679      	What if this mixture do not work at all?
2680      	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
2681      	No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

2682      	[Laying down her dagger]

2683      	What if it be a poison, which the friar
2684      	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
2685      	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
2686      	Because he married me before to Romeo?
2687      	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
2688      	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
2689      	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
2690      	I wake before the time that Romeo
2691      	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
2692      	Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
2693      	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
2694      	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
2695      	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
2696      	The horrible conceit of death and night,
2697      	Together with the terror of the place,--
2698      	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
2699      	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
2700      	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
2701      	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
2702      	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
2703      	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
2704      	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
2705      	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
2706      	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
2707      	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
2708      	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
2709      	Environed with all these hideous fears?
2710      	And madly play with my forefather's joints?
2711      	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
2712      	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
2713      	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
2714      	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
2715      	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
2716      	Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
2717      	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

2848      	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
2849      	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:

2853      	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
2854      	In all her best array bear her to church:

2872      	For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

2873      	[Exit]

2874      First Musician	Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

2875      	[Enter PETER]

2876      PETER	Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
2877      	ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

2878      First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'

2879      PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
2880      	heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
2881      	to comfort me.

2882      First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

2883      PETER	You will not, then?

2884      First Musician	No.

2885      PETER	I will then give it you soundly.

2886      First Musician	What will you give us?

2887      PETER	No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
2888      	I will give you the minstrel.

2889      First Musician	Then I will give you the serving-creature.

2890      PETER	Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
2891      	your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
2892      	I'll fa you; do you note me?

2893      First Musician	An you re us and fa us, you note us.

2894      Second Musician	Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

2895      PETER	Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
2896      	with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
2897      	me like men:
2898      	'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
2899      	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
2900      	Then music with her silver sound'--
2901      	why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
2902      	sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

2903      Musician	Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

2904      PETER	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

2905      Second Musician	I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

2906      PETER	Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

2907      Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.

2908      PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
2909      	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
2910      	because musicians have no gold for sounding:
2911      	'Then music with her silver sound
2912      	With speedy help doth lend redress.'

2913      	[Exit]

2914      First Musician	What a pestilent knave is this same!

2921      	[Enter ROMEO]

2922      ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
2923      	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
2924      	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
2925      	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
2926      	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
2927      	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
2928      	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
2929      	to think!--
2930      	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
2931      	That I revived, and was an emperor.
2932      	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
2933      	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

2934      	[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]

2935      	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
2936      	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
2937      	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
2938      	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
2939      	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

2940      BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
2941      	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
2942      	And her immortal part with angels lives.
2943      	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
2944      	And presently took post to tell it you:
2945      	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
2946      	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

2947      ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
2948      	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
2949      	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

2950      BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
2951      	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
2952      	Some misadventure.

2953      ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:
2954      	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
2955      	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

2956      BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.

2957      ROMEO	                  No matter: get thee gone,
2958      	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.

2959      	[Exit BALTHASAR]

2960      	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
2961      	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
2962      	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
2963      	I do remember an apothecary,--
2964      	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
2965      	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
2966      	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
2967      	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
2968      	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
2969      	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
2970      	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
2971      	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
2972      	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
2973      	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
2974      	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
2975      	Noting this penury, to myself I said
2976      	'An if a man did need a poison now,
2977      	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
2978      	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
2979      	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
2980      	And this same needy man must sell it me.
2981      	As I remember, this should be the house.
2982      	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
2983      	What, ho! apothecary!

2984      	[Enter Apothecary]

2985      Apothecary	Who calls so loud?

2986      ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
2987      	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
2988      	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
2989      	As will disperse itself through all the veins
2990      	That the life-weary taker may fall dead
2991      	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
2992      	As violently as hasty powder fired
2993      	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

2994      Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
2995      	Is death to any he that utters them.

2996      ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
2997      	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
2998      	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
2999      	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3000      	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3001      	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3002      	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

3003      Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.

3004      ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

3005      Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3006      	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3007      	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

3008      ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3009      	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3010      	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3011      	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3012      	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3013      	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3014      	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

3021      	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]

3022      FRIAR LAURENCE	This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3023      	Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3024      	Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

3025      FRIAR JOHN	Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3026      	One of our order, to associate me,
3027      	Here in this city visiting the sick,
3028      	And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3029      	Suspecting that we both were in a house
3030      	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3031      	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3032      	So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

3033      FRIAR LAURENCE	Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

3034      FRIAR JOHN	I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3035      	Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3036      	So fearful were they of infection.

3037      FRIAR LAURENCE	Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3038      	The letter was not nice but full of charge
3039      	Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3040      	May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3041      	Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3042      	Unto my cell.

3048      	Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3049      	But I will write again to Mantua,
3050      	And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;

3062      	Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3063      	But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3064      	As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3065      	Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

3088      	And do not interrupt me in my course.
3089      	Why I descend into this bed of death,
3090      	Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3091      	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3092      	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3093      	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3094      	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3095      	In what I further shall intend to do,
3096      	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3097      	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3098      	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3099      	More fierce and more inexorable far

3196      FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3197      	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

3198      BALTHASAR	Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

3199      FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
3200      	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
3201      	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
3202      	It burneth in the Capel's monument.

3203      BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3204      	One that you love.

3205      FRIAR LAURENCE	                  Who is it?

3206      BALTHASAR	Romeo.

3207      FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?

3208      BALTHASAR	Full half an hour.

3209      FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.

3210      BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir
3211      	My master knows not but I am gone hence;
3212      	And fearfully did menace me with death,
3213      	If I did stay to look on his intents.

3214      FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
3215      	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

3216      BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
3217      	I dreamt my master and another fought,
3218      	And that my master slew him.

3219      FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!

3220      	[Advances]

3221      	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
3222      	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3223      	What mean these masterless and gory swords
3224      	To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?

3225      	[Enters the tomb]

3226      	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
3227      	And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3228      	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
3229      	The lady stirs.

3230      	[JULIET wakes]

3231      JULIET	O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3232      	I do remember well where I should be,
3233      	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

3234      	[Noise within]

3235      FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3236      	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
3237      	A greater power than we can contradict
3238      	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3239      	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
3240      	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3241      	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
3242      	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
3243      	Come, go, good Juliet,

3244      	[Noise again]

3245      		 I dare no longer stay.

3246      JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

3247      	[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]

3248      	What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
3249      	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
3250      	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3251      	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
3252      	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
3253      	To make die with a restorative.

3254      	[Kisses him]

3255      	Thy lips are warm.

3256      First Watchman	[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?

3257      JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!

3258      	[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]

3259      	This is thy sheath;

3260      	[Stabs herself]

3261      	there rust, and let me die.

3262      	[Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]

3263      	[Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]

3264      PAGE	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

3265      First Watchman	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
3266      	Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
3267      	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
3268      	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3269      	Who here hath lain these two days buried.
3270      	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
3271      	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
3272      	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
3273      	But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3274      	We cannot without circumstance descry.

3275      	[Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]

3276      Second Watchman	Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

3277      First Watchman	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

3278      	[Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]

3279      Third Watchman	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
3280      	We took this mattock and this spade from him,
3281      	As he was coming from this churchyard side.

3282      First Watchman	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

3283      	[Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]

3284      PRINCE	What misadventure is so early up,
3285      	That calls our person from our morning's rest?

3286      	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]

3287      CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

3288      LADY CAPULET	The people in the street cry Romeo,
3289      	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
3290      	With open outcry toward our monument.

3291      PRINCE	What fear is this which startles in our ears?

3292      First Watchman	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
3293      	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
3294      	Warm and new kill'd.

3295      PRINCE	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

3296      First Watchman	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
3297      	With instruments upon them, fit to open
3298      	These dead men's tombs.

3299      CAPULET	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
3300      	This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
3301      	Is empty on the back of Montague,--
3302      	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

3303      LADY CAPULET	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
3304      	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

3305      	[Enter MONTAGUE and others]

3306      PRINCE	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
3307      	To see thy son and heir more early down.

3308      MONTAGUE	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
3309      	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
3310      	What further woe conspires against mine age?

3311      PRINCE	Look, and thou shalt see.

3312      MONTAGUE	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
3313      	To press before thy father to a grave?

3314      PRINCE	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
3315      	Till we can clear these ambiguities,
3316      	And know their spring, their head, their
3317      	true descent;
3318      	And then will I be general of your woes,
3319      	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
3320      	And let mischance be slave to patience.
3321      	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

3322      FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
3323      	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
3324      	Doth make against me of this direful murder;
3325      	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
3326      	Myself condemned and myself excused.

3327      PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

3328      FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
3329      	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
3330      	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
3331      	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
3332      	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
3333      	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
3334      	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
3335      	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
3336      	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
3337      	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
3338      	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
3339      	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
3340      	To rid her from this second marriage,
3341      	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
3342      	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
3343      	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
3344      	As I intended, for it wrought on her
3345      	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
3346      	That he should hither come as this dire night,
3347      	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
3348      	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
3349      	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
3350      	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
3351      	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
3352      	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
3353      	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
3354      	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
3355      	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
3356      	But when I came, some minute ere the time
3357      	Of her awaking, here untimely lay
3358      	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
3359      	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
3360      	And bear this work of heaven with patience:
3361      	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
3362      	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
3363      	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
3364      	All this I know; and to the marriage
3365      	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
3366      	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
3367      	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
3368      	Unto the rigour of severest law.

3369      PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.
3370      	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

3371      BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
3372      	And then in post he came from Mantua
3373      	To this same place, to this same monument.
3374      	This letter he early bid me give his father,
3375      	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
3376      	I departed not and left him there.

3377      PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
3378      	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
3379      	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

3380      PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
3381      	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
3382      	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
3383      	And by and by my master drew on him;
3384      	And then I ran away to call the watch.

3385      PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
3386      	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
3387      	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
3388      	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
3389      	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
3390      	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
3391      	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
3392      	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
3393      	And I for winking at your discords too
3394      	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

3395      CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
3396      	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
3397      	Can I demand.

3398      MONTAGUE   But I can give thee more:
3399      	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
3400      	That while Verona by that name is known,
3401      	There shall no figure at such rate be set
3402      	As that of true and faithful Juliet.

3403      CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
3404      	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

3405      PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
3406      	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
3407      	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
3408      	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
3409      	For never was a story of more woe
3410      	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

3411      	[Exeunt]
